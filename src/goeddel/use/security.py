# node construction that needs it (models/folder.py's directory listing) happens many
# layers below the router -- changing every signature in between just to plumb through
# "who is asking" would touch far more of the codebase than the check itself needs.
# This is safe under FastAPI/Starlette: each request runs in its own asyncio Task, and

# of times over. Keyed by username (not a single frozenset) so both the plain
# single-user case and the multi-user impersonation union share one shape: the
# middleware populates one entry per identity actually in play for the request.
# `None` (not an empty dict) means "not resolved yet for this context", so

# A folder listing is the degenerate case both rules were written for: every one
